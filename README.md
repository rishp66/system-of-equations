# java solutions
creating a program to calculate the solution for a system of equations
 ### Point:
 - Creates a Point object that is a specific location on an x/y graph
 
 ### Line:
- Creates a Line object based on 2 Point objects 
  - contains a y-intercept
  - contains a slope
 
### Rational:
- Creates a Rational object for when a slope of a Line turns into a repeating number
- Essentially converts slopes that are irrational or repeating decimals into a rational number or fraction

### System of Equations:
- Asks the user specific prompts based on the equation of the Line and calculates the slope into a Rational object
- Outputs a solution to the 2 Line system
